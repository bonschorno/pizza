# Pizza Napoletana 101 üçï

> ‚ÄúPer me la pizza deve avere il bordo alto, l‚Äôimpasto morbido che quando la pieghi non si deve spezzare. I dischi volanti li lascio agli ufo.‚Äù - Anonimo

This 101 is not about flying saucers, but about pizzas (or pizze in üáÆüáπ) that are still moist, have an airy crust and deliver a mouthwatering experience with just a few toppings.

This little guide should equally help those who feel lost in the flood of videos on 00 flours, San Marzano tomatoes and dough shaping techniques and those who just want to start making pizza in their homes. The instructions here are by no means complete or detailed enough to cover all the steps of pizza making. However, they are all based on experience (and science) and will work if followed.

## The recipe

Below is the basic recipe for four pizzas (~280g). The proportions are as follows: 100% flour, 65% water, 2% salt and 0.3% fresh yeast.

| Ingredient | Proportion (measured by the amount of flour) |
| --- | --- |
| 700g Flour | 100% |
| 455g Water | 65% |
| 14g Salt | 2% |
| 2g Fresh yeast oder 0.7-1g dry yeast | 0.3% |

If you want to experiment with other proportions or have to adjust the amount of dough, there is this super handy calculator by Pieter St√§dler: [https://www.stadlermade.com/pizza-dough-calculator/](https://www.stadlermade.com/pizza-dough-calculator/)

(Attention, the proportions for the salt and the yeast are not the same!)

## A quick guide on the ingredients

### Flour

Let's get this straight. No, you don't need special 00 flour from Italy to make good pizza! Ordinary white flour from the supermarket will do just as well. Nevertheless, I would like to urge you not to use the cheapest flour, but ideally to choose a locally, sustainably produced product. In most cases, it tastes better.

### Water

It does not have to be decalcified, demineralised or anything else. Tap water is perfectly fine.

### Salt

Here, too, ordinary salt is perfectly fine. The function of salt is fourfold:

1. Not surprisingly, salt gives flavour to the dough.
2. Salt interacts with the yeast and slows down its enzymatic activity (i.e. the conversion of sugars to carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol). This prolongs the fermentation time and creates more complex flavours.
3. Salt strengthens the gluten network, thus increasing the stability of the dough, which in turn leads to a nice airy dough that traps all the CO2.
4. Lastly, salt gives the dough a nicer crust.

### Yeast

To dispel another myth: Yes, you can mix salt and yeast directly together. Would you like an experimental setup? Voil√†: [https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/saltyeast.html](https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/saltyeast.html)

However, the statement of "salt kills yeast" is not completely false. In the words of Dr. Blonder (author of the linked article): ‚ÄúSalt is a widely used preservative, quickly drying out microbes and disrupting cell membranes. So, it is a matter of "common sense" to limit direct contact between yeast and salt when kneading dough.‚Äù

But as he sums up at the end: ‚Äúyou can add salt to a bread recipe whenever you prefer.‚Äù

## Process

Now to the steps for preparing the dough. I use a kneading machine for this. However, all the steps also apply if you prepare the dough by hand. It just gets a little messier.

1. Put the flour and the crumbled yeast (if you are using fresh yeast) into the bowl. Stir briefly on a low setting so that the two are well mixed.
2. Add all the water. Recipes often say to add the water gradually or to add almost all at the beginning and then add the rest at the very end, but in my experience the "all at once" method works best in ordinary kneading machines. The water is absorbed best this way, in my experience. Knead everything for about 10 minutes. At the end you should already have a reasonably smooth dough.
3. Now add the salt. Out of habit rather than necessity (see section on yeast), I add it now. You can also add it in the second step. Don't worry if after adding the salt the dough suddenly becomes softer again. I couldn't find out the exact reason for this (seems to have something to do with the inhibiting effect of salt), but there's no need to worry. Just keep kneading for 5min or until the dough is a nice smooth mass. Finally, form a ball.

*Tip for those who make the dough by hand. If after the 15 minutes the dough is still not nice and smooth, you can simply form it into a ball and leave it under a kitchen bowl or a damp cloth (just so it doesn't dry out) on the kitchen counter for another 15 minutes. This works wonders!*

---

1. Now place the dough ball in an oiled (makes it easier to take the dough out again afterwards) container that you can seal airtight (so that the dough doesn't dry out). Do yourself a favour and use a large enough container so that the dough can expand nicely. Be careful, the container and the dough respectively do not go into the fridge yet! Leave it in the container on the kitchen counter for 1-2 hours (depending on the temperature and time pressure) so that the yeast is activated. After 1-2 hours, you will see that the dough has become smoother and more relaxed, i.e. it has lost its shape. Now take the relaxed dough ball out of the container, form it into a tight ball again (to strengthen the dough even more) and put the ball back into the same oiled container. Optionally, cover the dough with a damp cloth before closing the container to ensure that the dough does not dry out in the fridge. Now put it in the fridge (5-7 degrees) for 16-19 hours.
2. The next day, shape the dough balls (280g each in this case). Depending on how moist your dough is, you can work it straight from the fridge (for high hydration) or wait 30 minutes to make it easier to shape (for low hydration).
Now place the shaped dough balls in a container sprinkled with flour or ideally durum wheat flour to make it easier to remove the balls. Place the balls in the container so that they are three to four fingers apart. Now you can close the container and let the dough rise again for at least 2 hours before you bake the pizza.
3. Now it's time to bake the pizzas! Heat your oven to the maximum temperature and, if available, choose the top and bottom heat setting instead of convection. This way the dough dries out less quickly in the oven.

How exactly to stretch the dough, how to prepare the tomato sauce (tip: 1g salt per 100g tomato sauce) and which mozzarella to use is beyond the scope of this recipe. However, the pizzaioli linked above offer very good advice and show you different techniques for spreading the pizza dough. No matter how you do it, keep one rule in mind: "Never touch the border!

Buon appetito!
